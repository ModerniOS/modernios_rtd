Getting Started
===============
In the early days of iOS development, there were hardly any sources. But these days one can find a variety of sources. Especially after the introduction of Swift, the number of resources increased very significantly. Since this is an online book, we will keep updating this list with the latest entries. As with other sections in the book, the list below is also intended to be opinionated, in other words we will not provide every possible blog, newsletter and training sources.

Blogs and Newsletters
---------------------
Below list is chosen based on the criteria and is updated regularly:

* Frequent updates - there are lots of other blogpost written less regularly or on places like Medium. You can find those ones by following the newsletters mentioned here or my twitter list.

* Authoritative, must-read blogposts - there are lots of blogs that are not necessarily considered as must read by the authors of this book. Some other blogs are mentioned even though they may not update regularly or even discontinued but their content is still relevant.

* And of course there may be many, we may be missing. Please submit pull-requests to the github repo and we will consider them for inclusion here.
